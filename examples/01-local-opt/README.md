# Task01: Local Optimization

CS265, Chengyi Lux Zhang

This directory contains various transformations for local optimizations. 

## Setting Up
I installed everything in conda, and the install script does not work 100% for me... 
So run this in every fresh terminal:
```
conda activate bril
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
